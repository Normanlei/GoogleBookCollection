# GoogleBookCollection

## Description

In this project, I am going to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later. For this project, I am going to build such a **React CRUD** application with **MERN Stack** Technique.

Here is how the application made of:
* UI: **React**
* Database: **MONGO** & **MONGOOSE SCHEMA**
* Backend: **Node**, **Express** 
* API: **Google Book API**
